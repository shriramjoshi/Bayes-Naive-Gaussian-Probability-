# Bayes-Naive-Gaussian-Probability
I have a (dummy)set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company . 
The objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email. 
I have used Gaussin Probality to predict the accuracy for the correct predictions based on training features and training labels.

One particular feature of Naive Bayes is that it’s a good algorithm for working with text classification. 
When dealing with text, it’s very common to treat each unique word as a feature, 
and since the typical person’s vocabulary is many thousands of words, this makes for a large number of features. 
The relative simplicity of the algorithm and the independent features assumption of Naive Bayes make it a strong performer 
for classifying texts. In this mini-project, you will download and install sklearn on your computer and use Naive Bayes 
to classify emails by author.
